# FasterFlights
Faster Flights is a project made by me using Python programming. It uses API calls in order to search for Ryanair flights from every airport in the United Kingdom to every airport in a country of your choice which is serviced by Ryanair given a date (or return date). There are both android and excel based implementations. For android, you may build the apk yourself using Kivy Buildozer by following the instructions here https://kivy.org/doc/stable/guide/packaging-android.html. Otherwise, please download the apk from the releases section noting that it should work on most phones.
